Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In other words, a class should be easily extendable without modifying the class itself.

Use case: Creating an Enemy base class that can be extended by various types of enemies (FlyingEnemy, GroundEnemy, etc.), without needing to modify the base Enemy class itself.
