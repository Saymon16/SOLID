The "Split Variable" refactoring technique is about splitting a single variable that is being used for multiple purposes into separate variables, each with a single, specific purpose.

This technique makes your code easier to understand and reduces the chance of introducing bugs. By ensuring each variable has only one purpose, you make your code more predictable and straightforward.
