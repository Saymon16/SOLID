The "Hide Delegate" refactoring technique is used when a client is making a request to an object, which then delegates the request to another object. This means that the client needs to be aware of the delegation, creating a dependency that might not be necessary.

If you encapsulate the delegation within the original object, the client doesn't need to know about the delegation, which can make the code cleaner and more maintainable.
