The "Replace Constructor with Factory Function" refactoring technique involves replacing the direct constructor call with a call to a factory function. The main advantage of this approach is that it provides more flexibility, since a factory method can return an instance of any of a number of subclasses, and it can also return a pre-existing instance or cache instances as necessary.
